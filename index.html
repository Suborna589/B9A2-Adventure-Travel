            <h1>Our popular Tour</h1> 
            <p>Tourism is travel for pleasure, and the commercial activity of providing and supporting such travel.Tourism has reached new dimensions with the emerging industry of space tourism, as well as the cruise ship industry. Another potential new tourism industry is virtual tourism.Other groupings derived from the above grouping:</p>
            <ul> 
            <li>onal tourism, a combination of domestic and outbound tourism</li> 
            <li>Regional tourism, a combination of domestic and inbound tourism</li> 
            <li>International tourism, a combination of inbound and outbound tourism</li>  
        </ul>
            <p>The terms tourism and travel are sometimes used interchangeably. In this context, travel has a similar definition to tourism but implies a more purposeful journey. The terms tourism and tourist are sometimes used pejoratively, to imply a shallow interest in the cultures or locations visited. By contrast, traveller is often used as a sign of distinction. </p>
